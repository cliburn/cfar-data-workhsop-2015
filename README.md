CFAR Workshop: Data Wrangling for Biologists
======

Excel is a wonderful tool for the exploration and analysis of small data sets, but quickly becomes unwieldy and error-prone as the size and complexity of data grows. This course focuses on moving the participant from Excel to power tools (the Jupyter notebook, the Unix command line, the pandas data frame, and the sqlite relational database) for scrubbing, transforming, querying and visualizing your data. Examples will show how to combine laboratory and clinical data and extract useful information from them. The emphasis is on developing the data management skills and best practices to cope with ever-growing biomedical data sets. No programming experience is required, but the course will be easier if you have some experience with a scripting language such as R, Python or Matlab.
